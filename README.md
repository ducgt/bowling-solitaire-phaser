# bowling-solitaire-phaser

> Bowling solitaire implementation made in [Phaser](http://phaser.io). Based on the Bowling Solitaire game by Sid Sackson described in his book [A Gamut of Games](http://www.amazon.com/A-Gamut-Games-Sid-Sackson/dp/0486273474).

## Preview

You can play the latest version of the game [here](https://bowling-solitaire-demo.herokuapp.com/).

Supports mobile!

## Requirements

You can either just take the game source (`game.js`) or use the built in server to host the file. If you just want the game source, you can skip the installation steps and you will not need anything else.

 - npm
 - bower

## Running the Server

Install necessary dependencies for running server using NPM:
```shell
npm install
```

Start the server with:
```shell
npm start
```

Now just go to the root of port 8080 on your machine ([http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/))

## Controls

Drag the cards around the screen. To flip a card, start dragging it and press the `f` key.

Works on mobile, but there is currently no way to flip a card unless you have a keyboard (untested).
